This class was amazing, and doing it online couldn't have been a more perfect time. I would like to do cyber security and work for our U.S. government. I like the pace I'm working at now with all the free time I have it couldnt be a better time than now. I like the challenging  assignment the most to be honest. CSS was fun to work with in the HTML language. It was like putting a puzzle togehter, and I get joy out of putting puzzles together so it was both a joy and stressful at the same time. I learned that certain fonts have a way of luring in readers.
My biggest accomplishment in this course was maintaining a n A average and getting my career going by talking to the coaches in the office. If you stay the course and use resources available you will do fine. My short term goals are to make this training work for me on a lighter note land me a job. The people, students, and staff are amazing and you can understand what they are trying to teach you clearly. Just stick to the program and you'll go far. As far as I see it, no bad can come out of this.
